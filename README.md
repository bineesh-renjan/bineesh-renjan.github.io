## Hi there 👋
# inventory-risk-operations-analytics

**Role:** Business / Operations Analyst  
**Tech:** Power BI • SQL • Excel • Python (optional)  
**Scope:** Inventory risk, operational KPIs, governance-ready analytics (global context)

## TL;DR
Design and implement a scalable KPI suite and Power BI dashboard to identify inventory risk and operational inefficiencies across multi-location operations. Includes anonymised sample data, SQL ETL logic, dashboard visuals, and governance notes.

## Problem
Organisations operating across regions face inconsistent inventory visibility, delayed reporting, and unclear KPI definitions, leading to stockouts, inefficiencies, and decision risk.

## Approach
- Create anonymised, multi-location sample datasets
- Build SQL ETL pipelines to compute operational KPIs
- Develop Power BI dashboards with drilldowns and risk indicators
- Document KPI definitions and governance principles for cross-team consistency

## Results (demonstration)
- Clear visibility of high-risk SKUs and locations
- Standardised KPI definitions usable across regions
- Dashboard outputs suitable for executive and operational review

## How to run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Load `data/sample_data.csv` into Power BI or execute `scripts/etl.py`
3. Review dashboard screenshots in `/reports/dashboard-screenshots`

## Repository Structure
- `data/` – anonymised sample datasets  
- `scripts/` – SQL / Python ETL logic  
- `notebooks/` – analysis and validation  
- `reports/` – dashboard screenshots and exports  
- `docs/` – KPI definitions and governance notes
